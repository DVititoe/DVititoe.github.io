Yes. For the foreseeable future, I will be providing support, bug-\/fixes and updating the library with any new Arduino modules as they are released.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{What does the license exception in the License \& Legal section mean?}{What does the license exception in the License \& Legal section mean?}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md53}
This library uses the same license as Ki\+Cad\textquotesingle{}s own built-\/in parts library does, including the exception. The Ki\+Cad Libraries team have a \href{https://www.kicad.org/libraries/license/}{\texttt{ page which explains the meaning of the exception}}. My version of the exception uses slightly better wording, but the effect is the same.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md54}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why do the footprints not have an {\ttfamily Edge.\+Cuts} outline?}{Why do the footprints not have an {\ttfamily Edge.\+Cuts} outline?}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md54}
If I put in an {\ttfamily Edge.\+Cuts} outline, then those users who want to have a PCB larger than the module footprint would have to modify the footprint to do so. In my experience, it is far more common for users to want a PCB larger than the module anyway, so I prefer to cater to those users. If you want your PCB to be the same size and shape as the Arduino module, you can trace the {\ttfamily F.\+Silkscreen} or {\ttfamily B.\+Silkscreen} layer (as appropriate) out in the {\ttfamily Edge.\+Cuts} layer yourself, or you can modify the footprint to change the outline from {\ttfamily F.\+Silkscreen} or {\ttfamily B.\+Silkscreen} layer to {\ttfamily Edge.\+Cuts}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md55}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why do the Nicla Vision and Nicla Voice tile footprints have cut-\/outs?}{Why do the Nicla Vision and Nicla Voice tile footprints have cut-\/outs?}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md55}
The cut-\/outs are necessary to accommodate components on the back of those modules; without them the components would physically prevent you from getting the module\textquotesingle{}s pads down to the footprint\textquotesingle{}s SMD pads.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md56}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why does the whole footprint have an {\ttfamily F.\+Courtyard} or {\ttfamily B.\+Courtyard} outline? I can\textquotesingle{}t place my components where I need to!}{Why does the whole footprint have an {\ttfamily F.\+Courtyard} or {\ttfamily B.\+Courtyard} outline? I can\textquotesingle{}t place my components where I need to!}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md56}
Firstly, this does not stop you from placing your components wherever you want. It does mean that the Ki\+Cad DRC will, by default, report errors or warnings in some circumstances because the module footprint and your circuit\textquotesingle{}s footprints\textquotesingle{} courtyards are overlapping, but you can ignore or disable these errors/warnings without issue.

Secondly, the intention is that it acts as a warning to the user that they\textquotesingle{}ve put components in the \textquotesingle{}danger zone\textquotesingle{} between their PCB and the Module. I do not model all of the tall components on the module, so it is possible that a user might unknowingly place their own tall component in a position that would conflict with one on the module. My hope is that the DRC errors/warnings will flag this potential problem to the user to manually check that their placement does not conflict with the module.

In principle I\textquotesingle{}m open to marking the taller components specifically, which would remove this issue, but this is a lot of work and requires data I don\textquotesingle{}t have access to for all the modules.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md57}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why is this Power Pin set to Power Input/\+Power Output/\+Unconnected? I get DRC errors because of it!}{Why is this Power Pin set to Power Input/\+Power Output/\+Unconnected? I get DRC errors because of it!}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md57}
The short answer is that some power pins on some modules can be used as either inputs or outputs, depending on your circuit design / where you\textquotesingle{}re powering the assembly from.

For those pins where I\textquotesingle{}ve been able to categorically confirm that the given power pin is {\ttfamily Unconnected} by default, or must necessarily be a {\ttfamily Power Input} or a {\ttfamily Power Output}, I have set it as such. For those pins that can be used as either an input or output, I have set it to {\ttfamily Power Input} as this is the more flexible option whilst still preserving some element of DRC capability. If you\textquotesingle{}re using one of these {\ttfamily Power Input} pins as a {\ttfamily Power Output} from the module, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to add the special {\ttfamily PWR\+\_\+\+FLAG} component to the affected net to make the DRC error go away.
